This C++ program is a simple clock application that allows the user to input an initial time (in hours, minutes, and seconds) and then displays the time in a continuous loop, updating every second. The program utilizes the Windows API for certain functions like clearing the console screen (system("cls")) and introducing a delay (Sleep(1000)).
These lines include the necessary header files. <iostream> is used for input and output operations, and <windows.h> is used for Windows-specific functions like Sleep and system("cls").This line brings the entire std (standard) namespace into the current scope, allowing you to use standard C++ functions without prefixing them with std::.This line brings the entire std (standard) namespace into the current scope, allowing you to use standard C++ functions without prefixing them with std::.
